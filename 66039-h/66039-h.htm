<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rain outside was cold in Hadrian's soul.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The boy lay dead</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the low couch, on whose denuded whole,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To Hadrian's eyes, whose sorrow was a dread,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The shadowy light of Death's eclipse was shed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The boy lay dead, and the day seemed a night</span><br />
<span class="i0">Outside. The rain fell like a sick affright</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of Nature at her work in killing him.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Memory of what he was gave no delight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Delight at what he was dead and dim.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O hands that once had clasped Hadrian's warm hands,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose cold now found them cold!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O hair bound erstwhile with the pressing bands!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O eyes half-diffidently bold!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O bare female male-body such</span><br />
<span class="i0">As a god's likeness to humanity!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O lips whose opening redness erst could touch</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lust's seats with a live art's variety!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O fingers skilled in things not to be told!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O tongue which, counter-tongued, made the blood bold!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O complete regency of lust throned on</span><br />
<span class="i0">Raged consciousness's spilled suspension!</span><br />
<span class="i0">These things are things that now must be no more.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The rain is silent, and the Emperor</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sinks by the couch. His grief is like a rage,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the gods take away the life they give</span><br />
<span class="i0">And spoil the beauty they made live.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He weeps and knows that every future age</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is looking on him out of the to-be;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His love is on a universal stage;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A thousand unborn eyes weep with his misery.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Antinous is dead, is dead for ever,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is dead for ever and all loves lament.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Venus herself, that was Adonis' lover,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seeing him, that newly lived, now dead again,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lends her old griefs renewal to be blent</span><br />
<span class="i0">With Hadrian's pain.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now is Apollo sad because the stealer</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of his white body is for ever cold.</span><br />
<span class="i0">No careful kisses on that nippled point</span><br />
<span class="i0">Covering his heart-beats' silent place restore</span><br />
<span class="i0">His life again to ope his eyes and feel her</span><br />
<span class="i0">Presence along his veins Love's fortress hold.</span><br />
<span class="i0">No warmth of his another's warmth demands.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now will his hands behind his head no more</span><br />
<span class="i0">Linked, in that posture giving all but hands,</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the projected body hands implore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rain falls, and he lies like one who hath</span><br />
<span class="i0">Forgotten all the gestures of his love</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lies awake waiting their hot return.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But all his arts and toys are now with Death.</span><br />
<span class="i0">This human ice no way of heat can move;</span><br />
<span class="i0">These ashes of a fire no flame can burn.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Hadrian, what will now thy cold life be?</span><br />
<span class="i0">What boots it to be lord of men and might?</span><br />
<span class="i0">His absence o'er thy visible empery</span><br />
<span class="i0">Comes like a night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor is there morn in hopes of new delight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now are thy nights widowed of love and kisses;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now are thy days robbed of the night's awaiting;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now have thy lips no purpose for thy blisses,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Left but to speak the name that Death is mating</span><br />
<span class="i0">With solitude and sorrow and affright.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy vague hands grope, as if they had dropped joy.</span><br />
<span class="i0">To hear that the rain ceases lift thy head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thy raised glance take to the lovely boy.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Naked he lies upon that memoried bed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">By thine own hand he lies uncovered.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There was he wont thy dangling sense to cloy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And uncloy with more cloying, and annoy</span><br />
<span class="i0">With newer uncloying till thy senses bled.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His hand and mouth knew games to reinstal</span><br />
<span class="i0">Desire that thy worn spine was hurt to follow.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sometimes it seemed to thee that all was hollow</span><br />
<span class="i0">In sense in each new straining of sucked lust.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then still new turns of toying would he call</span><br />
<span class="i0">To thy nerves' flesh, and thou wouldst tremble and fall</span><br />
<span class="i0">Back on thy cushions with thy mind's sense hushed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«Beautiful was my love, yet melancholy.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He had that art, that makes love captive wholly,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of being slowly sad among lust's rages.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now the Nile gave him up, the eternal Nile.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Under his wet locks Death's blue paleness wages</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now war upon our wishing with sad smile.»</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even as he thinks, the lust that is no more</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than a memory of lust revives and takes</span><br />
<span class="i0">His senses by the hand, his felt flesh wakes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all becomes again what 'twas before.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dead body on the bed starts up and lives</span><br />
<span class="i0">And comes to lie with him, close, closer, and</span><br />
<span class="i0">A creeping love-wise and invisible hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">At every body-entrance to his lust</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whispers caresses which flit off yet just</span><br />
<span class="i0">Remain enough to bleed his last nerve's strand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O sweet and cruel Parthian fugitives!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he half rises, looking on his lover,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That now can love nothing but what none know.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Vaguely, half-seeing what he doth behold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He runs his cold lips all the body over.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And so ice-senseless are his lips that, lo!,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He scarce tastes death from the dead body's cold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But it seems both are dead or living both</span><br />
<span class="i0">And love is still the presence and the mover.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then his lips cease on the other lips' cold sloth.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, there the wanting breath reminds his lips</span><br />
<span class="i0">That from beyond the gods hath moved a mist</span><br />
<span class="i0">Between him and this boy. His finger-tips,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still idly searching o'er the body, list</span><br />
<span class="i0">For some flesh-response to their waking mood.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But their love-question is not understood:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The god is dead whose cult was to be kissed!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He lifts his hand up to where heaven should be</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cries on the mute gods to know his pain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let your calm faces turn aside to his plea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O granting powers! He will yield up his reign.</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the still deserts he will parched live,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the far barbarous roads beggar or slave,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But to his arms again the warm boy give!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Forego that space ye meant to be his grave!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take all the female loveliness of earth</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in one mound of death its remnant spill!</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, by sweet Ganymede, that Jove found worth</span><br />
<span class="i0">And above Hebe did elect to fill</span><br />
<span class="i0">His cup at his high feasting, and instil</span><br />
<span class="i0">The friendlier love that fills the other's dearth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The clod of female embraces resolve</span><br />
<span class="i0">To dust, O father of the gods, but spare</span><br />
<span class="i0">This boy and his white body and golden hair!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Maybe thy better Ganymede thou feel'st</span><br />
<span class="i0">That he should be, and out of jealous care</span><br />
<span class="i0">From Hadrian's arms to thine his beauty steal'st.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was a kitten playing with lust, playing</span><br />
<span class="i0">With his own and with Hadrian's, sometimes one</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sometimes two, now linking, now undone;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now leaving lust, now lust's high lusts delaying;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now eyeing lust not wide, but from askance</span><br />
<span class="i0">Jumping round on lust's half-unexpectance;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now softly gripping, then with fury holding,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now playfully playing, now seriously, now lying</span><br />
<span class="i0">By th' side of lust looking at it, now spying</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which way to take lust in his lust's withholding.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus did the hours slide from their tangled hands</span><br />
<span class="i0">And from their mixed limbs the moments slip.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now were his arms dead leaves, now iron bands;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now were his lips cups, now the things that sip;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now were his eyes too closed and now too looking;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now were his uncontinuings frenzy working;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now were his arts a feather and now a whip.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That love they lived as a religion</span><br />
<span class="i0">Offered to gods that come themselves to men.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sometimes he was adorned or made to don</span><br />
<span class="i0">Half-vestures, then in statued nudity</span><br />
<span class="i0">Did imitate some god that seems to be</span><br />
<span class="i0">By marble's accurate virtue men's again.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now was he Venus, white out of the seas;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now was he Apollo, young and golden;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now as Jove sate he in mock judgment over</span><br />
<span class="i0">The presence at his feet of his slaved lover;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now was he an acted rite, by one beholden,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In ever-repositioned mysteries.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now he is something anyone can be.</span><br />
<span class="i0">O stark negation of the thing it is!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O golden-haired moon-cold loveliness!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Too cold! too cold! and love as cold as he!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Love through the memories of his love doth roam</span><br />
<span class="i0">As through a labyrinth, in sad madness glad,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now calls on his name and bids him come,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now is smiling at his imaged coming</span><br />
<span class="i0">That is i'th' heart like faces in the gloaming&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mere shining shadows of the forms they had.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rain again like a vague pain arose</span><br />
<span class="i0">And put the sense of wetness in the air.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Suddenly did the Emperor suppose</span><br />
<span class="i0">He saw this room and all in it from far.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He saw the couch, the boy, and his own frame</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cast down against the couch, and he became</span><br />
<span class="i0">A clearer presence to himself, and said</span><br />
<span class="i0">These words unuttered, save to his soul's dread:</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«I shall build thee a statue that will be</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the continued future evidence</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of my love and thy beauty and the sense</span><br />
<span class="i0">That beauty giveth of divinity.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though death with subtle uncovering hands remove</span><br />
<span class="i0">The apparel of life and empire from our love,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet its nude statue, that thou dost inspirit,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All future times, whether they will't or not,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall, like a gift a forcing god hath brought,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Inevitably inherit.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«Ay, this thy statue shall I build, and set</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the pinnacle of being thine, that Time</span><br />
<span class="i0">By its subtle dim crime</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will fear to eat it from life, or to fret</span><br />
<span class="i0">With war's or envy's rage from bulk and stone.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fate cannot be that! Gods themselves, that make</span><br />
<span class="i0">Things change, Fate's own hand, that doth overtake</span><br />
<span class="i0">The gods themselves with darkness, will draw back</span><br />
<span class="i0">From marring thus thy statue and my boon,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Leaving the wide world hollow with thy lack.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«This picture of our love will bridge the ages.</span><br />
<span class="i0">It will loom white out of the past and be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Eternal, like a Roman victory,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In every heart the future will give rages</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of not being our love's contemporary.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«Yet oh that this were needed not, and thou</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wert the red flower perfuming my life,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The garland on the brows of my delight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The living flame on altars of my soul!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Would all this were a thing thou mightest now</span><br />
<span class="i0">Smile at from under thy death-mocking lids</span><br />
<span class="i0">And wonder that I should so put a strife</span><br />
<span class="i0">Twixt me and gods for thy lost presence bright;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were there nought in this but my empty dole</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thy awakening smile half to condole</span><br />
<span class="i0">With what my dreaming pain to hope forbids.»</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus went he, like a lover who is waiting,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From place to place in his dim doubting mind.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now was his hope a great intention fating</span><br />
<span class="i0">Its wish to being, now felt he was blind</span><br />
<span class="i0">In some point of his seen wish undefined.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When love meets death we know not what to feel.</span><br />
<span class="i0">When death foils love we know not what to know.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now did his doubt hope, now did his hope doubt;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now what his wish dreamed the dream's sense did flout</span><br />
<span class="i0">And to a sullen emptiness congeal.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then again the gods fanned love's darkening glow.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«Thy death has given me a higher lust&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A flesh-lust raging for eternity.</span><br />
<span class="i0">On mine imperial fate I set my trust</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the high gods, that made me emperor be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will not annul from a more real life</span><br />
<span class="i0">My wish that thou should'st live for e'er and stand</span><br />
<span class="i0">A fleshly presence on their better land,</span><br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
